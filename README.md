# Office Developer AI Tools

This repo holds tools for developers of add-ins and other extensions of Office. Some are non-AI scripts. Others are AI tools, such as extended prompts, skills, agents, and actions that can be used in GitHub Copilot and other AI applications.

## Extended Prompts

**Note**: The prompts in this repo are substantial. For some helpful, brief prompts, see [Office Add-ins prompts for GitHub Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/resources/resources-github-copilot-prompt-library).

The extended prompts listed in the table below are tested with one or more of Copilot, Microsoft 365 Copilot, or GitHub Copilot, except where specified otherwise. They should work also in any AI tool that supports the required abilities listed.

Each extended prompt file is in a folder that includes a file of instructions for the human user of the prompt, as well as one or more other files that are consumed by the AI tool.

| Prompt | Purpose | Required Abilities | Supported By | Not Supported By |
|--------|---------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|
